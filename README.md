# Controlled-Robot-based-on-Hand-Gesture-using-Arduino
Robotics has become an emerging technology in the field of science. Robots are wired as well as wireless. It can be controlled using hand gesture too because robots need a helping hand whether it be any function, without human robots cannot be operated. The main purpose of using hand gestures is that it provides a more natural way of controlling the robot and with this feature robot can be used for example as wheelchair or a spy robot. As human hand gestures are natural, with the help of wireless communication, it is easier to interact with the robot in a morefriendly way. The robotâ€™s movement depends on the gestures made by hand. This project describes about the gesture control robot which can be controlled by your normal hand gesture. It consists of mainly two parts, one is transmitter part and another is receiver part. The transmitter will transmit the signal according to the position of accelerometer attached on the hand and the receiver will receive the signal and make the robot move in respective direction. In this project, the program is designed by using Arduino. The experimental results have been provided the proposed design meets its desired goals.
